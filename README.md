# Whitelabel

Whitelabel apps can be thought of as generic apps that exist to be a template for more custom development. 

On the master branch you'll find the auth flow is already taken care of:
1. bloc
    1. Auth
    2. User
2. data
    1. entity
        1. AuthType
        2. Auth
        3. User
    

3. Auth, Auth Type, and User
